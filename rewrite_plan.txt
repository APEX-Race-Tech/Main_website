# Frontend Rewrite Plan for APEX Race Technologies Website

## 1. Project Goal

To create a modern, stable, and maintainable single-page website that delivers a premium user experience. This rewrite will address all existing bugs related to navigation, layout, and animations, and will establish a robust foundation for future development.

### Key Features to Implement:
-   **Fixed, Transparent Header:** A navigation header that is always visible at the top of the viewport with a transparent background effect.
-   **Mobile Menu:** A collapsible menu on the mobile with a hamburger icon.
-   **Dynamic shrinking header and logo swap:** The header will shrink when scrolling down and the logo will swap to a smaller version, the whole header will have a rounded square bill background.
-   **Smooth Scroll-Snapping:** Seamless, full-page scrolling that snaps to each section.
-   **Dynamic Background Animations:** The racing lines animation on the home section and the track animation on all other sections.
-   **Responsive Design:** A fully responsive layout that works flawlessly on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
-   **Interactive Elements:** Smooth fade-in animations for content, a functional mobile menu, and interactive form submissions.
-   **Clean Layout:** No unexpected spacing or layout breaks, particularly in the contact and footer sections.

## 2. Technology and Best Practices

-   **HTML5:** Semantic HTML for improved accessibility and SEO.
-   **CSS3:**
    -   **BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) Methodology:** For creating scalable and maintainable CSS class names (e.g., `.header`, `.header__logo`, `.header--scrolled`).
    -   **CSS Custom Properties (Variables):** For consistent theming (colors, fonts, spacing).
    -   **Flexbox and Grid:** For robust and responsive layouts.
    -   **Native CSS Scroll Snap:** To avoid complex and fragile JavaScript solutions.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):**
    -   **Modularity:** Code will be split into modules for better organization and reusability (e.g., `nav.js`, `animations.js`, `forms.js`).
    -   **Intersection Observer API:** For performant scroll-based animations and active navigation link highlighting.
    -   **Event Delegation:** For efficient event handling.

## 3. Proposed File Structure

A clean and intuitive file structure will be created to make the codebase easy to navigate.

/website
|-- /assets
|   |-- /images
|   |   |-- logo.svg
|   |   |-- ...
|   |-- /fonts
|       |-- ...
|-- /css
|   |-- main.css      (Primary stylesheet)
|   |-- _variables.css (CSS Custom Properties)
|   |-- _base.css     (Global styles, resets)
|   |-- _layout.css   (Header, footer, grid)
|   |-- _components.css (Buttons, cards, forms)
|   |-- _animations.css (All animation keyframes and classes)
|-- /js
|   |-- main.js       (Main entry point, initializes modules)
|   |-- api.js        (Handles API calls for forms)
|   |-- ui.js         (Handles UI interactions like mobile menu, smooth scroll)
|   |-- animations.js (Handles IntersectionObserver logic for animations)
|-- index.html

## 4. Implementation Plan

The rewrite will be executed in phases to ensure a structured and testable process.

-   **Phase 1: Foundational HTML & CSS**
    1.  Create the new `index.html` with a clean, semantic structure.
    2.  Set up the new CSS file structure and implement variables and base styles.
    3.  Implement the core layout using CSS Grid/Flexbox, including the main scroll container.

-   **Phase 2: Core Components & Styling**
    1.  Style the header, navigation, and footer.
    2.  Style the full-page sections and reusable components (cards, buttons, forms).
    3.  Implement the CSS scroll-snapping.

-   **Phase 3: JavaScript Interactivity**
    1.  Create the main JavaScript entry point (`main.js`).
    2.  Implement the mobile menu functionality.
    3.  Implement smooth scrolling for navigation links.
    4.  Implement form submission logic with API calls.

-   **Phase 4: Animations & Final Polish**
    1.  Re-implement the background racing lines and track animations.
    2.  Implement the fade-in-on-scroll content animations.
    3.  Implement the active navigation link highlighting.
    4.  Conduct thorough cross-browser testing and final responsive adjustments.

## 5. Review and Approval

Please review this plan. Once you approve it, I will begin the rewrite process by deleting the existing frontend files and creating the new structure as outlined above.
