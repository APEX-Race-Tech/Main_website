RACE Insight Website Content Proposal
This document contains specialized content extracted from the RACE Insight software for use on the marketing website.

1. Data Import
Seamless Ingestion for High-Performance Analysis

RACE Insight features a high-performance Rust-powered backend designed to handle large-scale motorsports telemetry data with zero lag.

Universal Format Support: Direct support for industry-standard formats including MoTeC (.ld), iRacing (.ibt), AiM (.xrk, .drk), RaceLogic (.vbox), and custom CSV mappings.
High-Speed Processing: Built with Axum & Tokio, our backend parses files as large as 200MB+ in seconds, preparing them for instant visualization.
Automated Heuristics: Smart lap detection and min-max downsampling ensure your data is clean and accurate, preserving critical peaks such as brake lock-ups and wheel spin-outs.
Offline Reliability: Leverages IndexedDB for local persistence, allowing you to ingest once and analyze anywhere, even without an internet connection.

2. Data Overview and Management
Intelligent Session Intelligence at a Glance

The Data Overview hub provides a comprehensive interface for managing your entire racing career's worth of data.

Advanced Session Queue: Instantly filter through thousands of sessions by Track, Driver, or Vehicle. Sort by date, lap count, or best lap time to find the data you need.
Real-Time Previews: Select a session to view instant performance statistics, including average lap times, consistency scores, and theoretical bests.
Lap Breakdown Analytics: Detailed lap tables with delta-time highlights and inlap/outlap markers, allowing you to focus on your fastest sectors.
Interactive Spatial Previews: Integrated GPS track maps and lap-time trend charts provide immediate context for every session before you dive into deep analysis.
3. Analysis
High-Fidelity Visualization for Split-Second Decisions

The analysis engine is the heart of RACE Insight, providing professional-grade graphing tools that keep up with your data.

Professional Graphing Engine: High-fidelity time-series visualization using ECharts, optimized for 100Hz+ telemetry data with fluid 60FPS interaction.
Synchronized Ecosystem: A unified cursor system ensures that moving your mouse on a graph updates the track map, G-force gauges, and technical widgets simultaneously.
Multi-Lap Comparison: Compare laps with ease. Our system interpolates data between laps of different frequencies to provide perfectly aligned delta comparisons.
Customizable Organization: Group channels, synchronize Y-axes for similar metrics, and resize windows to create the perfect view for your specific engineering needs.
4. Custom Workbook (AI Workbook)
Your Modular Mission Control

Build a bespoke analysis environment with our drag-and-drop modular workspace.

AI-Driven Layout Generation: Use natural language to instantly create custom workbook layouts and complex analysis graphs tailored to your specific racing discipline.
Dynamic Workspace Canvas: A futuristic, grid-snapping canvas where you can place, resize, and arrange widgets to create your ideal dashboard.
Modular Library: Choose from a growing library of professional widgets:
Speed & RPM Dials
Driver Input Dashboards (Throttle/Brake/Steering)
Professional Tyre Monitors
G-Force Gauges & Hybrid System Monitors
AI-Driven Technical Bulletins: Get intelligent system feedback and setup notes directly in your workbook. Our technical bulletins provide live feeds of firmware alerts, track condition updates, and setup change logs.
Saved Environments: Create and save multiple workbook layouts (e.g., "Qualifying View", "Endurance Race Management") and switch between them instantly.
5. Data Export
Open Compatibility for Professional Workflows

RACE Insight respects your data sovereignty, ensuring you can move your data wherever it needs to go.

Standardized CSV Export: Export your refined telemetry data to a clean, well-documented CSV format compatible with Excel, MATLAB, and specialized data science tools.
MoTeC Ecosystem Integration: Generate .ldx metadata files to preserve event details and beacon markers across professional analysis software.
Metadata Management: Edit and export session metadata (Venue, Driver, Event) to keep your local archives and professional logs perfectly organized.
Batch Exporting: Efficiently process and export multiple laps or entire sessions for external reporting and team sharing.
