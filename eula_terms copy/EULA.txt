================================================================================
3. AUTHENTICATION AND ACCOUNT REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

3.1 Google Sign-In Required

To use RACE Insight in the production version, you must:

- Have a Google account
- Sign in with your Google credentials (Google Sign-In)
- Accept Google's privacy and terms of service

Skip login is not available in production builds. Google Sign-In is required to access the Software.

3.2 What Happens During Sign-In

When you sign in with Google, we collect your Firebase UID, email address, and display name. This data is stored only by Google/Firebase, not on our servers. See Privacy Policy Section 2 for details.

3.3 Your Account Responsibility

You are responsible for:

- Keeping your Google account credentials secure
- Protecting your email and account information
- Notifying us if your account is compromised
- All activity under your account

================================================================================
4. DATA STORAGE AND PRIVACY
================================================================================

4.1 Local-Only Storage

RACE Insight stores all your data locally on your device:

- Your project files and analysis remain on your computer
- We do not upload your telemetry data to our servers
- We do not back up your files to the cloud
- You maintain complete control of your files

File metadata (file type, file size) is tracked via PostHog analytics. Your actual file data is never sent to us.

4.2 Supported File Formats

RACE Insight can import and analyze telemetry data in these formats:

- iRacing (.ibt)
- AiM (.xrk, .drk)
- MoTeC (.ld, .ldx)
- CSV (Generic)
- Autosport Labs (.log)
- RaceLogic VBOX (.vbo)
- Under Development: ECUMaster (.adulog), Race Technology (.run), MegaLogViewer (.mlg)

File Size Limit: Maximum 250MB per file. The Software may warn for files larger than 1GB but will attempt processing.

4.3 Data Processing

When you import a telemetry file, the Software parses the file locally (backend processes on your machine), analyzes the data (lap detection, sector times, calculations), displays results in the user interface, and never sends the file contents to our servers.

4.4 Exported Data

When you export data (CSV, JSON, PDF), exported files are yours to keep and use. You own all exported data and reports, you can share and use exported data however you want, and you may use exported data for commercial purposes.

================================================================================
5. ANALYTICS AND DATA COLLECTION
================================================================================

5.1 Automatic Event Tracking

The Software collects anonymous usage data via PostHog to improve the application. Tracked events include: when you launch the app, when you sign in/out, when you import files, when you use features, and when errors occur.

What is not tracked: your telemetry data files, your analysis results, your personal information (unless you sign in), session recordings (disabled), and automatic click tracking (disabled).

5.2 Opting Out of Analytics

You can disable all analytics at any time:

1. Open RACE Insight
2. Go to Settings > Analytics & Privacy
3. Toggle "Disable Analytics & Telemetry"

Disabling analytics will stop PostHog event tracking, but Firebase may still log authentication events separately.

5.3 PostHog Configuration

PostHog is configured with session recording disabled, autocapture disabled (manual event tracking only), and default retention of 30 days.

See Privacy Policy Section 5.1 for details about PostHog.

================================================================================
