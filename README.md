# Race-Insight-and-Moto-Insight

This project is a web-based telemetry data visualization tool for motorsports. It allows users to upload telemetry data from racing sessions, which is then processed and displayed in an interactive and animated format on a track map. The application consists of a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend powered by Node.js.

## File-by-File Breakdown

### Root Directory (`website/`)

- **`.gitignore`**: A standard Git configuration file that specifies which files and directories to exclude from version control. This typically includes `node_modules`, `.env` files, and other generated or sensitive files.

- **`ART_loading.gif`**, **`apex_orange_Horizontal.svg`**, **`apex_orange_ONLY LOGO.svg`**: These are image assets used throughout the website. `ART_loading.gif` is likely a loading indicator, while the SVG files are logos.

- **`bg animation/`**: This directory contains assets for a background animation, enhancing the visual appeal of the website.

- **`index.html`**: The main entry point of the application. It defines the structure of the web page, including the track visualization canvas, data upload forms, and other UI elements.

- **`js/`**: This directory houses the client-side JavaScript files, which control the interactivity and dynamic features of the website.

- **`server/`**: This directory contains the backend of the application, which is responsible for handling data uploads, processing telemetry data, and serving it to the frontend.

- **`style.css`**: The primary stylesheet for the website. It contains all the CSS rules for styling the HTML elements, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.

### JavaScript Directory (`website/js/`)

- **`api.js`**: This file manages communication with the backend API. It contains functions for making HTTP requests to upload telemetry data and fetch processed data for visualization.

- **`main.js`**: The core JavaScript file for the frontend. It handles user interactions, such as form submissions and button clicks, and orchestrates the overall behavior of the client-side application.

- **`track-animation.js`**: This file is dedicated to rendering the track animation. It uses the processed telemetry data to draw the track and animate the vehicle's movement, providing a dynamic visualization of the race session.

### Server Directory (`website/server/`)

- **`.env`**: This file stores environment-specific variables, such as API keys and database credentials. It is not committed to version control for security reasons.

- **`.env.example`**: An example file that shows the required environment variables. This serves as a template for developers to create their own `.env` file.

- **`README.md`**: This file provides specific documentation for the backend, including setup instructions and API endpoint details.

- **`node_modules/`**: This directory contains all the Node.js packages and dependencies required by the server. It is automatically generated by `npm install`.

- **`package-lock.json`**: This file records the exact versions of the project's dependencies, ensuring that the application is consistent across different environments.

- **`package.json`**: The manifest file for the Node.js project. It lists the project's dependencies, scripts, and other metadata.

- **`server.js`**: The main entry point for the backend server. It sets up the Express.js application, defines the API endpoints, and handles all server-side logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vignesh1410-tech/Race-Insight-and-Moto-Insight.git
   cd Race-Insight-and-Moto-Insight/code/website
   ```

2. **Install server dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory by copying `.env.example`.
   - Fill in the required environment variables.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Open the frontend:**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. **Upload Telemetry Data:**
   - Use the file upload form on the website to select and upload your telemetry data files.

2. **View Visualization:**
   - Once the data is processed, the track animation will be displayed on the screen, showing the vehicle's path and other relevant telemetry information.
